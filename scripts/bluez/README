Note that scripts under this folder do NOT use HDPy stack; they connect
to BlueZ HDP implementation (that can be found in normal tree), or to 
the "apocryph" MCAP plug-in (*)

These scripts are here mostly for convenience, because they
use a couple features from HDPy modules, and because we were
lazy to create a separate project just to hold these scripts :)


(*) The MCAP plugin can can be found at http://gitorious.org/bluez-epx,
abranch "pts". It gives direct access to BlueZ MCAP protocol implementation,
but it is NOT meant for production use; it is a means to test MCAP
(using PTS or other tools).
